Displayed in the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York Painted from the window of his asylum room in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, The Starry Night captures Van Gogh’s emotional and spiritual response to nature. The swirling sky, punctuated by luminous stars and a bright crescent moon, mirrors the artist’s turbulent inner life while celebrating the immensity of the universe. The cypress trees in the foreground stretch upward, linking earth and heaven in a single, restless rhythm. Today, it stands as a symbol of artistic passion and resilience.
