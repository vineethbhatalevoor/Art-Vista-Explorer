The Scream embodies the anxiety of the modern age. With its distorted figure, fiery sky, and rippling landscape, Munch visualized a “scream passing through nature.” The work bridges symbolism and expressionism, using color and form to convey raw psychological tension. Its haunting image of existential dread has transcended art history to become one of the most recognizable icons of human emotion.
